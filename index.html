        <p class="introParagraph">Hiking and camping are two of my favorite past-times. While the mention of camping may bring images of national parks to mind, there are an abundance of state and local parks, wilderness areas, and national forests to explore in the greater St Louis region. </p>
        <p class="introParagraph">These are some of the hikes I’ve been on in Missouri and southern Illinois since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. I could happily recommend any of them for a nice day hike, although you can spend more time in many of them.</p>

          <p class="hikeBlurb">
            Don Robinson State Park is dominated by sandstone formations that have been worn away by water over time. The Sandstone Canyon trail occupies the eastern half of the park and follows one such feature cared by the creek that runs its length.

          <p class="hikeBlurb">
            Garden of the Gods is a recreation area located in the southwest corner of Illinois, inside the Shawnee National Forest. The area’s most striking feature is the uplifted sandstone plateau and the erosion formed hoodoos (an uncommon formation for the Midwest) accessible via the ¼ mile Observation Trail. Besides the observation trail, the area features miles of interconnected trails so hikes can be tailored to comfort.
          </p>
          <p>The granite rocks formations in the center of the park span a large area, interlaced with paths and trails that make it a fun park for families to explore together. Young children and the childlike at heart will have fun running and climbing amongst the granite boulders.</p>

            Hawn State Park is located about an hour south of St. Louis, in Ste. Genevieve County. When I was there, they had just finished a prescribed burn in a portion of the park! I walked along the Whispering Pines trail that partially divided a burned area from an unburnt section. The forest in which the park is situated is a mix of both pine and oak.
