          <p class="hikeBlurb">
            Garden of the Gods is a recreation area located in the southwest corner of Illinois, inside the Shawnee National Forest. The area’s most striking feature is the uplifted sandstone plateau and the erosion formed hoodoos (an uncommon formation for the Midwest) accessible via the ¼ mile Observation Trail. Besides the observation trail, the area features miles of interconnected trails so hikes can be tailored to comfort.          </p>
