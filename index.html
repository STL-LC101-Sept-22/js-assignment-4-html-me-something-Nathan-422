        <p id="postTitle">Hikes in the greater St Louis region</p>
        <p class="introParagraph">Hiking and camping are two of my favorite past-times. While the mention of camping may bring images of national parks to mind, there are an abundance of state and local parks, wilderness areas, and national forests to explore in the greater St Louis region. </p>
        <p class="introParagraph">These are some of the hikes I’ve been on in Missouri and southern Illinois since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. I could happily recommend any of them for a nice day hike, although you can spend more time in many of them.</p>

            Elephant rock state park is beautiful small-medium state park in southern Missouri. It's 1-mile paved trail is fully accessible for wheelchairs and includes braille directional, and information signage making it accessible to hikers with vison or mobility impairments. Its name comes from the giant granite formations that formed 1.5 billion years ago.

          <p class="hikeBlurb">
            Don Robinson State Park is dominated by sandstone formations that have been worn away by water over time. The Sandstone Canyon trail occupies the eastern half of the park and follows one such feature cared by the creek that runs its length.

          <p class="hikeBlurb">
            Garden of the Gods is a recreation area located in the southwest corner of Illinois, inside the Shawnee National Forest. The area’s most striking feature is the uplifted sandstone plateau and the erosion formed hoodoos (an uncommon formation for the Midwest) accessible via the ¼ mile Observation Trail. Besides the observation trail, the area features miles of interconnected trails so hikes can be tailored to comfort.

            I hiked and camped here with some friends. We stayed long enough to get caught in a storm, but it was summer and none of us minded. It’s an incredible landscape that is well worth the trip for the unique geology. According to a sign along the trail the formations we see today are iron-rich which slowed its erosion compared to the less iron-rich rock that had surrounded it. It’s hard to even capture the crazy formations we saw here in photos. Many of the rocks felt like they had been carved by hand to resemble the surface of the ocean, or a lake on a windy day.

            Hawn State Park is located about an hour south of St. Louis, in Ste. Genevieve County. When I was there, they had just finished a prescribed burn in a portion of the park! I walked along the Whispering Pines trail that partially divided a burned area from an unburnt section. The forest in which the park is situated is a mix of both pine and oak.

            I hiked here in the late fall with a group of friends who camped the night in the park. The hike we took was a four-mile loop that wove amongst hills and over partially-frozen streams.

          <p class="hikeBlurb">
            The Ozark Trail spans a little more than 390 miles at the moment between Missouri and Arkansas, with plans to ultimately link to the Ozark Highlands Trails bringing the length to the range of 700 miles.

            While this is definitely more than a day hike, much of the trail is easily accessible from trailheads and can make for a great day’s outing. There are of course caveats to this advice, the sections I’ve done in southern Missouri snake up and down the mountains (if they can be called that) making for a reasonable challenge for someone wearing a heavy pack. Missouri is of course also hot, and home to ticks and other biting insects that thrive in the summer conditions. Take appropriate care when doing extended hiking to ensure you have enough water and someone knows your travel plans and will alert the authorities if you are not back when expected.

            The practical dangers of hiking aside, the views and scenery of the OT are absolutely beautiful. Sunny glades adorn the hilltops, covered in granite boulders left behind by retreating glaciers and lichen that thrives amidst these dense rocks. While the highest point in Missouri is only about 1,000 feet above sea level, the views from the tops of the hills are wonderful, looking out over forests and hills as far as the eye can see.
